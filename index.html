                        It seems like such a surreal experience that we happened the way we did. I still remember you dragging me along to dance on the last day of 10th Grade. I remember being grumpy and annoyed at everything, but if I rememeber that day fondly, it is because of you Adira.

                        If I belive in fate, it is because one random day, I asked Nikita if you were still there in school and I decided to go along with her and have lunch. You were there on the back of my mind because of the vibe you gave off. Chaotic? Very much, but someone I enjoyed being around? Yes. Who knew it would turn out to the be the best decision of my life?

                    <p class="text-base">
                        I will be honest, I was less nervous when I was facing an auditorium full of people in Pune and walked onto the stage to participate in the competition, when compared to asking you to be my girlfriend. I had stayed up all night thinking about how I would pop the question and how I would feel if you said yes (or if you said no :( ). That was honestly one of the toughest nights of my life, and asking you the next day was even more nerve wracking. I do not remember an ounce of what was taught that day in school or how the weather was because I was so lost and nervous in asking you, that I almost fainted. But I knew that I would not be able to rest unless I got an answer. And well, it turned out to be a no ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­.

                        I remember being annoyed when you asked me to stay back after lunch because you wanted to talk. I say annoyed because I was hurting from being rejected and I wanted to get as far away from you as possible lol. But my heart did not really give me a choice as it still wanted to be with you. <!--reread and complete the paragraph>
